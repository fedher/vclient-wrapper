## vClient wrapper (2013)

At the time I built up this wrapper, the API to retrieve info from vSphere 
service was difficult to use and hard to understand. So, I decided to create
this small project to make easier get info from virtual machines handled
by vSphere service. To do so, I wrote the wrapper based on the VMware VI (vSphere)
Java API [1]. This was used to connect to the vSphere version 5.1.
